The output from Git was not easy to read in my terminal, as the colors were very dull and blended into the background. When connected to a multimedia projector/TV it became totally unreadable. So, I created a simple color scheme, which makes the default colors mole vibrant. If you want to try it out, just add the lines from the `.gitconfig` file to your own `.gitconfig`.
